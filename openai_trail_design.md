# üß≠ The OpenAI Trail ‚Äî Game Design Overview

A parody re-imagining of the 1985 *Oregon Trail*, themed around the **California State University (CSU)** system‚Äôs 2025 rollout of ChatGPT EDU.

---

## üéÆ Core Concept
Players lead a CSU-wide initiative to deploy ChatGPT across 23 campuses before the end of 2025.  
They must balance limited resources, governance reviews, staff morale, and AI adoption metrics while encountering random events (budget freezes, FERPA audits, viral success stories).

Goal:  
Successfully reach the ‚ÄúMaritime Academy‚Äù (final campus) with your team intact, reputation solid, and usage metrics high.

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| `/data/text_prompts.json` | All dialogue, menu text, and event messages. Easily editable by non-coders. |
| `/assets/images/` | Retro pixel art: campus map, staff avatars, dialog windows. |
| `/src/ui/menus.js` | Renders menus using text from `text_prompts.json`. |
| `/src/game/logic.js` | Core state machine controlling resources, pacing, and random events. |
| `/src/game/events.js` | Table of event probabilities, conditions, and effects. |
| `/data/flow.json` | Controls scene order and default transitions so writers can steer the campaign. |
| `/src/scenes/` | Scene-specific render logic (store, rollout, review meetings, leaderboard). |
| `/style/retro.css` | 16-color palette + monospace styling (simulate Apple II look). |
| `/src/scenes/progressScene.js` | Animated campus progress readout screen. |
| `/src/scenes/quizScene.js` | Text-only branching quiz menu for kickoff choices. |

---

## üîÄ Steering the Flow

Scene transitions are data-driven via `/data/flow.json`. Set `initialScene` to change the game‚Äôs starting point and edit entries in the `transitions` map to reroute default paths. Each key follows the pattern `sceneName.event`:

- `role_selection.select`: triggered after the player locks in a role.
- `team_naming.submit`: when the team form is completed.
- `resource_allocation.finish`: when the player leaves the staffing screen.
- `launch_briefing.continue`: when the Chancellor‚Äôs Office splash is dismissed.
- `quiz_intro.select`: choice made on the kickoff strategy quiz.
- `progress_status.continue.1/2/3`: branching points after each status check (routes to quiz_phase2/4/6).
- `quiz_phase2.select`, `quiz_phase3.select`, `quiz_phase4.select`, `quiz_phase5.select`, `quiz_phase6.select`: follow-up quizzes in the rollout cycle.
- `cutscene_maritime.continue`, `cutscene_channel_islands.continue`, `cutscene_long_beach.continue`: campus beat screens tying into the progress loop.
- `cutscene_golden_bear.continue`, `cutscene_channel_islands.continue`, `cutscene_long_beach.continue`: cut-scene beat screens tied to their respective backgrounds.
- `progress_status.continue`: rollout progress dashboard with animated header.

### Testing Aids

- Tap the subtle ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù button in the top-right corner of the frame to jump directly to the Chancellor‚Äôs Office launch briefing during development.
- You can deep-link to any scene by appending its ID as a hash (e.g. `/#quiz_phase2`). The URL updates automatically as you navigate so you can refresh or share a specific page.

Update the target scene string to steer the campaign without touching JavaScript.

## üèÅ Game Flow

### **Main Menu**
```
THE OPENAI TRAIL
---------------------------------
1. Roll out ChatGPT
2. Learn about the CSU
3. See the Rollout Leaderboard
What is your choice? _
```

### **Character Selection**
```
Many people played a role in rolling out ChatGPT across the CSU.
You may:

1. Be a System-Wide CIO
   (High influence, high expectations, few excuses)
2. Be a Campus Engagement Partner
   (Knows the people, limited authority, big heart)

   (Has the keys to the network... and the budget)
4. Be a Senior Technology Strategist
   (Underpaid, overworked, but somehow keeps it all together)

What is your choice? _
```

Each profession sets starting ‚Äúresources,‚Äù analogous to Oregon Trail‚Äôs money and difficulty.

|------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| CIO | $1600 | Easiest | √ó1 |
| Engagement Partner | $800 | Balanced | √ó2 |
| Strategist | $400 | Hardest | √ó3 |

### **Team Naming**
```
What is the name of your rollout team? _
Name your teammates:
1. _
2. _
3. _
4. _
Each will have their own strengths... and their own meeting fatigue.
```

---

### **Start Timing**
```
It is 2025.
AI has suddenly become a critical technology.
You must decide when to begin your system-wide rollout of ChatGPT.

1. Right now (January)
2. Not an option
3. Not an option
4. Not an option

What is your choice? _
```

### **Resource Allocation Menu**
```
Before starting this rollout, you should acquire dedicated resources.
You have funds for 0 new FTEs.

You may:
1. Secure a Faculty Innovation Fellow
2. Reassign a Systems Administrator

    "options": ["Rush it", "Prepare documentation", "Wait", "Hire consultants"]
  }
}
```

---

## üîß Development Notes
- Game logic should read from `text_prompts.json` and `events.json`, so writers can update all content without touching JS code.  
- Use a retro-style font (e.g. *Press Start 2P*).  
- Sounds: simple square-wave ‚Äúbeeps‚Äù for menus and alerts.  
- Maintain a modular event system (`events.js`) for random incidents and probability rolls.

---

‚úÖ **Next Steps**
1. Build a simple HTML/JS prototype that loads `text_prompts.json` ‚Üí renders menus.
2. Add state tracking for budget, morale, engagement, and progress.
3. Attach imagery from `/assets/images/`.
4. Integrate events and scoring.
5. Export final build as a web game playable in browser.
